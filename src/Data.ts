    text: `I'm a Software Engineer who thrives on crafting elegant, efficient solutions. With expertise
          in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, SQL, and OOP, I transform complex code into clean,
          maintainable art. Unit testing? Absolutely, I believe in bulletproofing code to keep it
          reliable. I’m constantly learning and researching to stay ahead of the curve. My
          passion? Taking tangled codebases and refactoring them with design
          patterns and any principles that fits, ensuring they’re as readable as your favorite book and as
          maintainable as a fine-tuned machine. If it’s about making code better, I'm all in!`,

      title: "Refactoring Legacy Code to Clean Structure",
      text: `Faced with a legacy codebase that was challenging to develop and maintain, I took the
              initiative
              to refactor it into a clean, modular structure. By implementing centralized exception
              handling,
              request validation, programming to interfaces, and dependency injection, I transformed the
              code
              into a more maintainable and readable state. This resulted in enhanced development
              efficiency
              and improved code quality across the system.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Resolving Concurrency Issues",
      text: `Encountered data anomalies due to concurrency problems like Lost Updates and Write Skew. To
              address this, I introduced optimized solutions such as strategic locking mechanisms and
              improved
              transaction isolation levels. These efforts successfully eliminated the anomalies, ensuring
              data
              consistency and reliability throughout the system.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Elevating API Efficiency with Reactive Refactoring",
      text: `Identified a severed API performance bottlenecks. I resolved it by transforming sluggish query and heavy 
      blocking calls into efficient non-blocking processes. Slashing response times from over a minute to under a second`,
    },
    {
      title: "Customizable Client Behaviors with Design Patterns",
      text: `Faced with the challenge of diverse client behavior requirements, I implemented design
              patterns
              such as Strategy, Command, and Factory Method. This solution provided each client with the
              flexibility to choose and utilize their desired behavior seamlessly.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Optimizing Pagination for Faster Load Times",
      text: `To address slow load times with numeric pagination, I revamped the filtering strategy to
              focus on
              date-based filters and implemented a "load more" pagination approach. This significantly
              reduced
              page load times and improved the overall user experience.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Enhancing Transaction Management with Custom Annotation",
      text: `Legacy code lacked Spring Data JPA, making atomic transactions more complex than using the
              simple
              @Transactional annotation. I developed a custom transactional annotation using AOP, enabling
              centralized management of atomicity using ThreadLocal, isolation, and retryable transactions in the event of
              failures, replicating the behavior of Spring’s built-in transaction management.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Simplifying Unit Testing with Dependency Injection",
      text: `Some parts of the code were difficult to test due to hidden dependencies. I refactored the
              code
              to use dependency injection, making it easier to mock dependencies in unit tests and
              improving
              testability and maintainability.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Automating Query Logging for QA with AOP",
      text: `To streamline the testing process for the QA team, I developed an AOP-based solution that
              intercepts query generation outside of business logic and sends the query logs directly to
              their
              email. This approach enables QA to access the generated queries independently, without
              needing
              developer intervention.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Revolutionizing PDF Creation for Clarity and Ease",
      text: `Faced with a difficult-to-read PDF creator using OOP style, I migrated the system to an HTML-based
       solution. This transition simplified the process, allowing future PDF creation tasks to be handled easily by
        designing layouts with HTML and CSS, just like a webpage, ensuring clarity and flexibility in design.`,

       full-stack solution, utilizing Java for backend processes and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend interface.
        One challenge involved implementing a discount period feature that couldn’t overlap. Upon reviewing the
         database, I discovered PostgreSQL’s "overlap" keyword, which allowed me to simplify the logic significantly.
          By leveraging this feature, I eliminated the need for complex manual checks, resulting in a cleaner and more
